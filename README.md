# qpoly_plethysm: Quasipolynomial formulas for plethysm, after Kahle and Michalek.

Kahle and Michalek have computed quasipolynomial formulas for some families of pletysms of Schur functions. We believe these formulas are not optimal:
their domains are (non-cone) polyhedra instead of cones. In this work, we extract from the results of their calculations the optimal formulas.
