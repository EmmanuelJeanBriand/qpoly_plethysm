# qpoly_plethysm
Quasipolynomial formulas for plethysm, after Kahle and Michalek.

Kahle and Michalek have computed quasipolynomial formulas for some families of pletysms of Schur functions. We believe these formulas are not optimal:
their domains are (non-cone) polyhedra instead of cones. In this work, we extract from the results of their calculations the optimal formulas.
